# CIFAR Object Detection Using CNN Model
Welcome to the CIFAR Object Detection repository! This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, including airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. Our goal is to accurately identify these objects using a robust CNN model.

### Project Overview
*Objective*: To classify images into one of the 10 classes using a CNN model.
*Dataset*: CIFAR-10, consisting of 60,000 images across 10 categories.
*Model Architecture*: Our CNN model includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, carefully designed to extract and learn features from the images.

### Key Features
*Data Preprocessing*: Includes normalization and augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
*CNN Architecture*: Custom-built layers tailored for efficient learning and accurate classification.
*Training and Validation*: Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets to ensure robustness.
*Performance Metrics*: Utilization of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model.
*Visualization Tools*: Graphs and charts to visualize training progress and model performance.
